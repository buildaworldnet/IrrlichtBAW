//! A class automating process of loading Assets from resources, eg. files
/**
	Every Asset must be loaded by a particular class derived from IAssetLoader.
	These classes must be registered with IAssetManager::addAssetLoader() which will 
	add it to the list of loaders (grab return 0-based index) or just not register 
	the loader upon failure (don’t grab and return 0xdeadbeefu).

	The loading is impacted by caching and resource duplication flags, defined as IAssetLoader::E_CACHING_FLAGS.

	The flag having an impact on loading an Asset is a bitfield with 2 bits per level,
	so the enums provide are some useful constants. Different combinations are valid as well, so
	
	\code{.cpp}
    IAssetLoader::SAssetLoadParams params;
	params.cacheFlags = static_cast<E_CACHING_FLAGS>(ECF_DONT_CACHE_TOP_LEVEL << 4ull);
    //synonymous to:
    params.cacheFlags = ECF_DONT_CACHE_LEVEL(2);
    //where ECF_DONT_CACHE_LEVEL() is a utility function.
	\endcode

	Means that anything on level 2 will not get cached (top is 0, but we have shifted for 4 bits,
	where 2 bits represent one single level, so we've been on second level).
    Notice that loading process can be seen as a chain. When you're loading a mesh, it can references a submesh.
    Submesh can reference graphics pipeline and descriptor set. Descriptor set can reference, for example, textures.
    Hierarchy level is distance in such chain/tree from Root Asset (the one you asked for by calling IAssetManager::getAsset()) and the currently loaded Asset (needed by Root Asset).
    
	When the class derived from IAssetLoader is added, its put once on an 
	vector<IAssetLoader*> and once on an multimap<std::string,IAssetLoader*> 
	inside the IAssetManager for every associated file extension it reports.

	The loaders are tried in the order they were registered per file extensions, 
	and later in the global order in case of needing to fallback to examining files.

	An IAssetLoader can only be removed/deregistered by its original pointer or global loader index.
