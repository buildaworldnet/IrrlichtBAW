# IrrlichtBAW

Build A World fork of Irrlicht
We forked after realizing we have too many patches which entail big API changes to ever be merged into stock Irrlicht.

For those not faint of heart, you can find out more about what this is and how it differs from stock Irrlicht by reading this thread:

Excuse us for not providing a proper readme, I (devsh) am really busy with my day-business of Build A World EDU.

If you have ties to original irrlicht and feel like improving this repository's readmes and the wiki, contact devsh.
